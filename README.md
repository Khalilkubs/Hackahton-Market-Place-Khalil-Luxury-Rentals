Khalil Luxury Rentals – Car Rental Marketplace 

Car Rental Website built using Next.js 14+ and Sanity CMS, providing a seamless platform for users to browse, rent, and manage cars efficiently. The website features a user-friendly interface, allowing customers to explore detailed car listings, check availability, and make bookings. Users can also view their order history and track the status of their rentals.  
 Hackathon Completion  
I have successfully completed the hackathon within 24 hours. The website consists of 5 pages, including a responsive home page.  

- Home Page: Clicking on "View All" redirects to the Categories page.  
- Categories Page: Displays 8 products initially, with an option to show 4 more on button click.  
- Product Interactions:  
  - Nissan GT Car (Second product on Home Page) → Clicking "Rent Now" redirects to the Payment Page.  
  - Scrolling to the bottom of the Home Page, another "Rent Now" button redirects to the Admin Page.  
  - Clicking the Nissan car in Categories redirects to the Product Details Page.  

Car Rental Cart  
- Users can add multiple cars to the rental cart before proceeding to checkout.  
- The cart allows users to manage selections, remove vehicles, and finalize bookings efficiently.
